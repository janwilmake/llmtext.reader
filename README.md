An API that extracts readable content from web pages using Mozilla's Readability library.

Free to use for now, but please reach out if you like to use it at high scale.

TODO: Improve reader api

- reader.llmtext.com/md should become /txt
- create /md endpoint that gradually simplifies the html at /html, and put metadata in frontmatter
- create /links endpoint that parses the links from the /html
